## Advent of Code 2023

Since it's nearly time for Advent of Code 2024, and I'm keen to get a quick taste of a range of languages, I decided to take a look at doing some of the challenges from [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023). In general I'll be looking for succinct code over performant code since these are toy exercises, and not worrying too much about error handling unless relevant to the puzzle.

### Calendar

1. ["trebuchet"](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/1) - completed in ruby. Part two took a while due to overlooking the need for lookahead in a regular expression!
2. ["cube conundrum"](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/2) - completed in python. More straightfoward than day 1 thankfully!
3. ["gear ratios"](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/3) - created an (unnecessary) [vue app](https://velmanatov.github.io/advent-of-code-2023-day-3/) for this and solved in typescript!
4. ["scratchcards"](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/3) - solved in go
