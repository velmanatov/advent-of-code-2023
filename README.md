## Advent of Code 2023

Since it's nearly time for Advent of Code 2024, and I'm keen to get a quick taste of a range of languages, I decided to take a look at doing some of the challenges from Advent of Code 2023. In general I'll be looking for succinct code over performant since these are only toy exercises, and not worrying too much about error handling unless relevant to the puzzle.
